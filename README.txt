Welcome to Wrapper

Intro paragraph...

To get started using Wrapper the first thing you need is a running web server, localhost will work fine. Put the "wrapper_package" on your server and navigate to the location. You should see a simple page that says Hello World. 

There is a docs folder to get you started on all of the different parts of wrapper and a few simple files to get you started. 

If there is anything you are having trouble will make sure you send us a message and we'll try and get it worked out. 

There will be a site with better documentation soon.
